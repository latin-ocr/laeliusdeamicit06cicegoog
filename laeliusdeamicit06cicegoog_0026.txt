Galus Limus, surnamed SAPnrrvS, the constant com-
panion and friend 01 Scipio the younger, was the son 01
Gaius Laelius, who had been the friend 01 Scipio the
elder. He was born about 186 ac, and died at an un-
certain date, but probably not long after Scipio. He was
prominent in the state, being plebeian tribune 151, prae· .
tor 145, and consul 140, holding also the office 01 augur.

leader. Under the instruct ion of Diogenes, and aft erward'i ’.Δ . .' ,.
01 Panaetius, he adopted the Q philosophy, and, with
Scipio, became the center‘of that circle from whose pat-
