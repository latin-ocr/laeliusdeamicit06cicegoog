smera OF CICERO 7

compassos his knowledge the varied fields of thought
“Night and day,'’ said he, “l spent in the examination
of all branches of learning.'’ Such was his diligence and
power oi acquisition that when, at the age of twenty-sir, ⁶ 7

experienced orator which he lacked was familiarity with

, alarge audience.

But intense application exhausted the slender physique
of the young orator, and in 79 he left Rome to regain his
health. Going first to Athens which, from his love of
Greek letters, was a hallowed spot, he spent a year in
the study of philosophy and rhetoric, then, passing on to
Asia, studied rhetoric under various teachers, but espe-
cially under his old instructor, Molo oi Rhodes. At the
end oi two years he returned to Rome, renewed in health,
and with an improved literary and oratorical style. Much
oi its early redundancy had disappeared; and though it
was always, in his own figure, a full stream, it ceased to ,
overilow its banks. Business came to the brilliant young
advocate in abundance; and so popular did he become
that, without the aid of wealth or family influence, he was
elected quaestor in his‘thirty-first year— the first in which
he was eligible. His province was Lilybaeum, the western
part of Sicily, where he distinguished himself by a just
and righteous administration. So grateful was the remem-
brance of his people that, on his return to Rome, they
besought him to conduct the impeachment of their extor-
tionate and tyrannical err-governor, Gaius Verres. Prose-
cutions were contrary to Cicero‘s nature and principles—
in one other case only, that of T. Manutius Plancus, did he
appear as a prosecutor; but the requests were so urgent
that he consented. The result was the exile of Verres.
