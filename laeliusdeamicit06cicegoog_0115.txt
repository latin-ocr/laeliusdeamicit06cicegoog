Emeritus, of Latin, Harvard University

lNCE its first publication, this work has been more

widely used 't‘han any other Latin grammar for advanced

study and reference. It is approached by no other
American publication in completeness and in authoritativenesa,
and is conspicuous forits originality, sound scholarship, inter-
esting character, accurate analysis of constpuctions, copioua
illustratione, lively English renderings of the Latin exemplos,
and clear arrangement.
il The revision has been conducted under the direction of
Professor Mortis H. Morgan‚ who edited and completed the
original edition, left unlinished by the death of Dr. Lane.
In this revised edition the chapter on Sound has been entirely
rewritten, and enlarged from nineteen to thirty-one pages, by
Dr. Hanns Oertel, Professor of Comparative Philology in
Yale University. ln this rewriting the modern views con-
cerning the nature and kinds of vowels and consonants, the
Latin accent, and the phonetical laws under which changes
of vowel and consonant sound take place receive the
alterations requisite for meeting the needs of college studente.
Many changes have also been made in the chapters on
Inllection and Formation to make these correspond to the re-
written chapter on Sound. Throughout the boolt the working
of “hidden quantities'' has been completely revised.
il ln the syntactical chapters there area few changes in the
treatment of leading principles, such as the main con·
structione with cum, those with verbs of memory, and the
use of the subjunctive in prohibitions. For the most part,
however, no alterations have been found necessary in the
treatment of broad general principles, or in the method of
presentation.
