12 INTRODUCHON

recall of Cicero. It ought to have convinced him that it

was useless to talk of Curius and Fabricius in a state in

which patriotism had been exchanged for self-seeking, and
statesmanship for the arts of the demagogue.

Cicero's return was like a triumphal procession. Not-

withstanding his haste to see Rome, such crowds of friends

Μ erom all the towns delayed his journey, that he was Ἢ

ω, ΛΞ fou-r-d—ays in passing from Brundisium to Rome. When

there, aristocraey and plebeians vied with each other to

give him welcome. But his enemies were still lively and
strong. “My condition,’' wrote he to Atticus, “is for

Δ prosperity slippery‚ for adversity good.” He therefore
¹ withdrew, as far as possible, from public life, and while
still being the foremost advocate in the forum, and the
most eloquent speaker and the wisest counselor in the
senate, and still keeping all his interest in the welfare of

the state, betook himself more and more to the enjoyment

f h terary studies and composition. In the years that' rn-

53- satervened bet tween hist ret urn from exile and proconsulare

’ he wrote tthe De Oratore, De Republica, and De Legrbus.

His product rons were not as numerous as at a later time,

for his work was still mainly one of preparation. He was

“devouring literature‚'’ and giving himself “unreservedly

to the life most in accordance with nature, that of the
student.”

In 51, by the revival of a law that no consul should
enter upon a provincial government before five years from
the close of his consulship, the err-consuls of more than five
years’ standing were compelled to draw lots for the vacant
provinces Greatly to his disgust, Cicero drew the prov--
inee of Cilicia. The only satisfaction which his govem·
ment gave him was the opportunity to revisit Athens.
