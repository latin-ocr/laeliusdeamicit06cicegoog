and united its SQ to rhythm and melody ; while his

writings form the richest part of Latin literature, and, as
Quina—hap sayS, form the standard by which to test pro· (Μ
ficiency in Latin. Cicero was the leader of the Hellenic

culture of his time. He opened to his countrymen the σω* ¹· ,u
fountains of Greek philosophy, diffusing a knowledge iffi ll, t,
which before had been confined to a cultured few, and thvdr‘·
at the same time opening a new department in the use

of the Latin language. He was not an original philoso-

pher, but he had a philosophie mind of great power, and

loved philosophy for its own sake. It was to its pursuit “
that he turned in all the intervals of public activity‚ and to p ω h(
find rest in weariness and consolation in sorrow. “With-„raupi-
out thee,” he says of philosophy in his latest years, “what Ν amm
would my life have been? To thee do I come for refuge,
from thee do Ι implore aid, to thy hands do I commit
myself, asin my earlier life for the most part, so now
wholly and unreservedly. A single day within thy courts
is better than an immortality in the tents of wickedness.
Whose aid, then, shall Ι soone'r enjoy than thine, who hast
given me tranquillity of life and taken away the fear of
death ἓ ” Α thorough acquaintance with the various philo-
sophic systems of Greece enabled him not merely to trans-
late the works of the Greeks, but to ad—apt and remodel μμ ua.
them for the more p raetical Romans. It was, therefore,

a twofold debt that Rome owed Cicer0, -the enlargement

of her literary life, and the enriching of her language.
Without Cicero those great writers—Vergil, Horace, Livy,
and others whose works form the treasures of Latin liter-
ature-would have been impossible, at least as we know
them. To the debt of Rome to Cicero is to be added,
then, that of the cultivated world.
