his villas at Tusculum, Formiae, and Antium, where he
spent much time in study. A friend, Paetus, gave him a
valuable library, which was in Greece, and, in his anxiety
for such a treasure, he wrote to Atticus “ If you love me,
and feel sure of my love to you, use all the endeavors of
your friends, clientS, acquaintanceS, freedmen, and even
slaves, to prevent a single leaf from being lost.’'

The most melancholy period of Cicero’s life was the
year and a half of his exile. The severity of his disaster
overcame him. Neither friends nor his beloved books gave
him any comfort. His one companion was his misery.
Glorious memories and cheering hopes alike failed him.
He could only indulge his grief, and implore his friends to
aid him. These, in fact, did their utmost. Scarcely had
he left Rome when they began to take measures for his
recall. In a short time his return became the burning
political question of the day. The consuls of the next
year, and all the tribunes but one, were in his favor. The
