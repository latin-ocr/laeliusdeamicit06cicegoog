degree. His support of a measure was taken as a guaran-
tee that it was in accord with the spirit oi the past, and his
open opposition was difficult to withstand. When, there-
iore, crafty men -notably the great triumvirate, Caesar,
Crassus, and Pompey, who by their union became the strong-
est force in the state—began to lay masked schemes for
their own aggrandizement, they found it necessary for their
full success to draw Cicero to their side. The triumvirate
tried to win him by offers of various responsible positions‚
but, finding they could make no impression upon him, deter-
mined to remove him from the city- not openly, but by
leaving him to the malice of personal enemies.

There was a profligate young noble, Clodius by name,
who bad become incensed against Cicero because he had
testified against him when accused oi sacrilege. Having
been adopted into a plebeian family, he w'as'elected tribune,
and proceeded at once to take measures to have Cicero ban-
ished from the city. His charge against Cicero was the old
one of illegal execution of Roman citizens. ln March of 58
he was successful, and Cicero was interdicted from fire and
water-tle, banished on pain of death—within a distance
of five hundred miles from Rome. This result was reached
by the secret aid of ¹the triumvirate, or at least by their
acquiescence. From Caesar Cicero had little to expect;
but from Pompey, who owed his greatness in no small de-

. gree to the eloquence of Cicero, and who, since his return
from the East, had more than once been aided by the friend-
ship and the advocacy of the great orator, he had a right
to expect assistance. But regard for favors received and
the claims oi friendship weighed little against the prompt-

ι’ Μ, ,Ι ings of a selfish political purpose, and Pompey, with base
· - ingratitude, withdrew and left him naked to his enemies.
