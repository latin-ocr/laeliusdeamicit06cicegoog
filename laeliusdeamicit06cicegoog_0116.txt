sELECTloNs FROM LIVY ...... 31. 50

Edited by HARRY E. BURTON, Ph.D.‚ Professor of
Latin, Dartmouth college. Text Edition, βας 5

HESE selectioni are intended to give a more compre·

hensive idea of Livy's genius and versatility than can be ·

had stom the reading of any one or two books, and
also to provide material dealing with the more significant and
interesting periods of the early history of Rome. The pas-
sages are varied in nature, and are not confined to military
history3 they are not so short as to appear fragmentary. Each
subject is presented in a series of continuous chapters, the
notes supplying introductory and explanatory material for a
proper understanding of the period. There is a comprehen-
sive introduction, and a complete system of eroes-reference.

HORACE. ODES, EPODES, AND CARMEN

snscunnnn ......... μςο

Edited by CLlFFORD H. MOORE, rhu, Professor
of Latin, Harvard University. Text Edition, 3040

HILE elementary matters have not been neglected in

this edition, particular attention has been devoted to

the literary side of Horace’ s work, and to his literary
relations. The introduction, besides dealing with the poet's ‚
life and writings, discusses his lyric metres and peculi·
arities of syntax. The commentary is not limited to the
baldest aids, but is intended to give such assistance in
interpretation as may help students to some appreciation of
Horace's art and charm. The relation of the poet to his
Greek models, and especially his influence on subsequent
Latin literature, are clearly shown.
