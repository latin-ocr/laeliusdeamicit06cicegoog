NOTE TO THE REVISED EDITION

-οοο-

Tmr text adopted ior this work is that of Baiter and
Kayser. Any, changes from the standard text are men-
tioned in the notes.

ln preparing the notes, the aim has been to furnish
all explanations that seem necessary for the clear under·
standing oi points oi grammar, history, biography, and
ancient customs. In addition to this the attention of
the student has been called by translation, and remark
upon special passages to the literary character oi the
essay and to the clear and happy development oi
the subject. The quantities oi the long vowels have
been marked to aid the student in correct pronuncia-
tion, ior which the practice ol reading aloud is recom-
mended.

Many editions have been consulted, but chief assistance
has been received from those oi Lahmeyer, Long, Nauck,
Reid, and Seyffert, ior which credit is given in the notes.
l also wish to express my thanks to the editors of the Ameri-
can Book Company for their suggestions and assistance.
